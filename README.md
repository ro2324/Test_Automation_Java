Tasks 
================================================================
1. I have a pizza shop, which offers a Standard or Soft base. It also offers a selection of toppings from Tomato,  corn, mushrooms. Customers can choose one base and many toppings. The cost of the pizza is the cost of the base plus the cost of the selected toppings. 
Write code to represent this model in an Object-Oriented approach and calculate the cost of a given pizza. 

2. A bouquet consists of different types of flowers, Roses, Jasmines, Lilys etc. Consider a rose costs 1$, jasmine costs 2$, Lily costs 3$. The cost of the bouquet is the sum of the cost of the flowers in it.  Use the object-oriented approach to design the above situation and write a utility method to calculate the cost of the given bouquet. 

3. As part of assessing your programming skills, can you design a Java program to manage a New Year's gift with various chocolates and sweets? The program should establish a hierarchy for these confectioneries, 
create objects representing different sweets,calculate the total weight of a children's gift, implement a sorting mechanism for the chocolates based on a user-selected option, and identify candies within the gift that fall within a specified range of options. Please provide the code for each step and explain your design choices.

4. In a home, there are multiple appliances. Each appliance consumes a certain amount of power when â€œSwitch onâ€. eg: Home can have FAN, Light, TV, Laptop, etc. when "Switch on" they consume FAN-1 unit, Light - 2 units, TV-3 units etc power. Create a method to calculate the amount of power consumption at any given point (current load). 
Sort the devices in an apartment by one of (any) the parameters.
