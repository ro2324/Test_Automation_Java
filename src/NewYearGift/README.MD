3. As part of assessing your programming skills, can you design a Java program to manage a New Year's gift with various
   chocolates and sweets? The program should establish a hierarchy for these confectioneries, create objects
   representing different sweets,calculate the total weight of a children's gift, implement a sorting mechanism for the
   chocolates based on a user-selected option, and identify candies within the gift that fall within a specified range
   of options. Please provide the code for each step and explain your design choices.
